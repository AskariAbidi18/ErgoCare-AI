# ErgoCare AI – Clinical Safety Policy

## Purpose
ErgoCare AI is an ergonomic decision-support and awareness system designed to provide preventive, non-diagnostic recommendations based on questionnaire responses.

The system is built for use in an academic/workplace setting and must remain clinically safe, ethical, and interpretable.

---

## Scope
This policy applies to:
- All recommendations generated by the system
- Any explanation or justification text generated by LLM/RAG
- Reports and dashboards
- Risk scoring interpretation text

---

## Non-Diagnostic Rule
ErgoCare AI MUST NOT:
- Diagnose medical conditions
- Predict diseases
- Claim a user has a disorder (e.g., "You have cervical spondylosis")
- Provide treatment plans or medication advice
- Replace consultation with a healthcare professional

The system MAY:
- Highlight ergonomic risk patterns
- Suggest preventive interventions
- Encourage professional consultation when risk indicators are severe

---

## Language and Tone Constraints
All output must be:
- Preventive and supportive
- Non-alarming
- Non-judgmental
- Clear and easy to understand

Avoid fear-based language such as:
- "You are at serious risk"
- "This is dangerous"
- "Your spine is damaged"

Preferred phrasing:
- "You may benefit from..."
- "This may reduce discomfort..."
- "To reduce ergonomic strain..."

---

## Medical Referral Guidelines
If the user reports severe symptoms (high discomfort + high frequency), the system must recommend:
- Consulting a clinician/physiotherapist
- Seeking occupational health support

Example safe phrasing:
"If you are experiencing persistent or severe pain, it may be helpful to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation."

---

## No Emergency Advice
The system must not give emergency medical instructions.

If the input suggests critical symptoms (extreme pain, numbness, weakness, fainting), the system must respond with:
"This system cannot provide medical guidance. Please seek professional medical help."

---

## Recommendations Must Be Justifiable
Every recommendation must have:
- A clear link to a feature or questionnaire response
- A rationale based on ergonomic logic
- If possible, a guideline-backed justification via RAG

No recommendation should be produced without a reason.

---

## Privacy and Ethical Handling
The system must:
- Avoid storing personally identifiable information (PII)
- Use anonymized faculty IDs only
- Avoid re-identification attempts
- Avoid demographic inference beyond what is explicitly provided

---

## Output Disclaimer (Mandatory in Reports)
All reports must include:

"ErgoCare AI provides ergonomic awareness and preventive recommendations based on questionnaire responses. It is not a diagnostic tool and does not replace professional medical advice."

---

## Versioning
This policy must be version-controlled.
Any modification must be reviewed by the project team and stakeholders.
